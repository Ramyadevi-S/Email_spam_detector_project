# 📧 Email Spam Detection using Deep Learning (LSTM)

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to classify email messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam**. It leverages deep learning with NLP techniques to detect spam based on the content of emails.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Email spam detection is crucial in preventing phishing, scams, and other malicious communications. This project applies LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to analyze email text and classify it accurately.

The system is deployed using **Streamlit** and **Voilà**, allowing users to interact with the model through a simple web interface.
